          This game started as a cybersecurity training course for government
          employees. The need to improve employees' computer knowledge arose
          after studying the latest statistics that highlight how malware attack
          campaigns have been on the rise, especially towards the public
          administration, in recent years. All this, thanks to the collective
          superficiality aimed at IT security and the low level of digital
          literacy.

          The game is set inside the municipal offices, and the protagonist of
          the game is one of the employees. During the game the protagonist will
          experience the typical working day in the office. The idea is to
          reproduce the corporate reality, to make the user experience daily
          situations in order to be ready when certain dangers concerning IT
          security arise.
