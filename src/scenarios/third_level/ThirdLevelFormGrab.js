            "An HealtGuard expert Apolonio Garcia showed a TV channel how easy is to create a personal internet connection in a hotel. He created a connection and labeled it 'Hotel Wi-Fi' and demonstrated how easy it is for someone to see the information. The thief can create a mock hotel website. It looks just like the real website, but any credit card information that is used goes toward the thief's computer. 'You can easily create a fake page, have them enter their credentials, pass the user onto the legitimate website so the user doesn't know that they just gave you, the bad guy, their credit card information,' Garcia explained. According to security experts, 38% of credit card fraud occurs in the hotel industry, so while you relax on vacation, it is important to still stay alert. So whether it's in a hotel or an office, as in our case, you have to be careful when using a free and untrusted Wi-Fi network."
